# qq2

Back in 2021, I made [qqueue](https://github.com/whitgroves/qqueue) based on the ["breakable toy" pattern](https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382) to practice web development. This is another take at that concept, with the goal of putting more production-level practices ... into practice.

This one's just a standard Flask app (for now), so `flask --app .\app\ run` will start the app on port `5000`.
